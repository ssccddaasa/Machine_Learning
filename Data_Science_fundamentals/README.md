# Machine Learning and Data Science Assignment #1

## About the Assignment

In this assignment, we explore a dataset on car fuel consumption using Python. The dataset (`cars.csv`) is provided, and the tasks include:

1. Loading the dataset and examining its characteristics.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Analyzing fuel economy based on country of origin.
4. Investigating the distribution of selected features.
5. Implementing and evaluating linear regression models.
6. Utilizing the closed-form solution and gradient descent algorithms.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `assi.py`: Python script containing the solution code.
- `report_assi_1.pdf`: Report detailing the analysis and findings.
- `cars.csv`: Dataset file containing car information.

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
